<h1>About the Moon</h1>

<p>
  The Moon is far more than just a glow in the night sky.<br>
  It is a <strong>natural satellite</strong> that helps stabilize Earth's climate and generates the <em>tides</em> in our oceans.<br>
  With this project, we can observe its features with unprecedented clarity and unravel its mysteries like never before.<br>
  Our goal: <strong>to understand the Moon</strong> through a realistic visualization created from <em>millions of images</em>.

<h2>How Was the Moon Formed?</h2>
<p>
  Although its exact origin remains an enigma,<br>
  scientists believe it was born from a <strong>catastrophic</strong> collision:<br>
  a Mars-sized celestial body struck the early Earth,<br>
  and the resulting debris coalesced in orbit to form the Moon we know today.
</p>

<h2>The Moon's Internal Structure</h2>
<p>
  The Moon has <strong>three main layers</strong>:<br>
  <strong>• Crust</strong><br>
  <strong>• Mantle</strong><br>
  <strong>• Core</strong>
</p>

<p>
  Billions of years ago, the Moon was an entirely molten world.<br>
  As it cooled, denser materials—such as <em>iron</em>—sank toward the center,<br>
  while lighter materials—like certain silicate rocks—rose to the surface.<br>
  The result: a <strong>solid inner core</strong>, a <strong>mostly solid mantle</strong> (with partially molten regions),<br>
  and a <strong>thin outer crust</strong>.
</p>

<h3>The Lunar Core</h3>
<p>
  Composed of two parts:<br>
  – A <strong>solid inner core</strong> made of iron.<br>
  – A <strong>liquid outer core</strong> also containing nickel and sulfur.
</p>

<h3>The Lunar Mantle</h3>
<p>
  This is the Moon's thickest layer.<br>
  Although primarily solid, the region near the core is <em>partially molten</em>,<br>
  and it is here that some <strong>moonquakes</strong> may originate.<br>
  It is mainly composed of <em>basalt rich in olivine and pyroxene</em>.
</p>

<h3>The Lunar Crust</h3>
<p>
  It’s not uniform!<br>
  – On the <strong>far side</strong>: approximately 60 km thick.<br>
  – On the <strong>near side</strong>: only about 40 km thick.<br>
  Scientists are still investigating why this striking difference exists.
</p>

<p>
  Its composition includes:<br>
  <em>oxygen, silicon, magnesium, iron, calcium, and aluminum</em>,<br>
  along with traces of <em>titanium, uranium, thorium, potassium, and hydrogen</em>.
</p>

<p>
  The bright, elevated regions (highlands) are rich in <strong>calcium and aluminum</strong>,<br>
  whereas the dark, flat areas—known as <em>lunar maria</em>—<br>
  contain higher amounts of <strong>iron and titanium</strong>.
